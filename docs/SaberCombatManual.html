OJP Enhanced Saber System Manual</B> <BR><BR>Hello everyone!!!!
Thankyou so much for downloading this mod and choosing to <B>read
this manual because if you don&rsquo;t know what your doing in this
saber combat, you&rsquo;ll think its all random, you&rsquo;ll get
frustrated, and die very quickly!!</B> (which happens way too often
and it shouldn&rsquo;t) This manual was originally meant for a
technical writing college class so it may seem a bit weird in is
format at times. The purpose of this manual is to instruct players
who are new to OJP Enhanced on how to use its very different and
unique saber system. This manual assumes that you already have a
moderate to advanced level of understanding on how the base Jedi
Academy saber system works. Without such knowledge, you will have a
more difficult time understanding the content of this manual. This
manual covers all of the major changes to the saber system and gives
step-by-step instructions on how to perform certain critical moves.
It is important to note that the new saber system was designed to be
more movie-like than the base Jedi Academy (JA) saber system. <BR></FONT><BR>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Because
of the length of this manual, I have created a quick start guide to
help players just start playing without reading everything. This
quick outline on how to play is very summarized and I would highly
recommend still reading the rest of the manual so you understand the
system in detail and to see the <B>visual movie references</B> to the
moves (the hud is a little dated on the movies though). You will be
less likely to defeat more knowledgable players without knowing this
system in the highest detail.<BR><BR><B>Quick Start guide:</B><BR><BR>Important
notes:<BR><BR>1. Your blue meter is your Dodge/block (DP) meter is
your lifeline. It will go down very fast if you don't parry block
most of the hits on you. When your defenses are down from a stumble,
knockdown are a saberless hit, you will &quot;dodge&quot; the hit
matrix style and loss double DP.<BR><BR>2. The empty meter that files
up as you hit your opponent is called your mishap/balance meter. If
goes up faster if he parry blocks you alot. The higher your balance
meter is, the more vulnerable you are to kicks and getting stumbled,
knocked down, or disarmed.<BR><BR>3. You lose force points by
swinging. At 10 FP or less, you swing and move really slowly and are
completely vulnerable to lunge.<BR><BR>4. Walk 75% or more during a
fight because you lose double DP for hits on you if you run and it
fatal to get hit in a jump. Running and hitting someone will do
double DP damage to them, but if you get hit while swinging or from
behind, it will kill you instantly.<BR><BR>5. Comboing on your swings
is often the key to winning a fight, but do it strategically because
you can still be beaten or win with pure defensive playing.<BR><BR>6.
Kicks are available in all styles and cash in on your where your
opponents balance/mishap meter is or when they are at critical DP. It
will cause a knockdown when your opponent is high on the
balance/mishap meter or critical DP, a stumble a around &frac12;
mishap, or get absorbed by a backflip when they are low. Holding alt
attack when getting kicked will block or reduce your mishap effect at
any mishap level<BR><BR>7. you will notice that you get paused in
combat where you can move from time to time. This is usually due to
your balance meter getting high and you got parry blocked or you just
got reposited. You get slowbounced at 1/3+, heavybounced at 2/3+ or
critical DP, and disarmed, stumbled, knockdown at 9/10 of your
Balance/mishap meter. More info and visual references on these are in
the offical manual.<BR><BR>8. There are now a total of 7 styles to
choose from at full saber attack points in single saber. You can also
do lunge and yellow DFA in any single saber style and a red DFA in
both purple and red styles (purple style looks diferent in its DFA
though)<BR><BR>Moves:<BR><BR>Parry block (this is the most important
technique): Hold the directional key to move into whatever side your
getting hit on. A and D for side hits, S for high swings (up-down
swings) and W for lunge and low hits. This move lessens hit damage on
you greatly. If your opponents balance/mishap meter is very high,
they my maxout their mishap meter and fall down or lose their
saber.<BR><BR>Startfake: tap attack. This fakes people out and is
important for reposites<BR><BR>Attack Feint (attack fake): hold
attack and alt attack with a directional key (basically like doing a
kata except you are doing a normal swing with it). This does more
damage than a normal swing, puts your opponent into a saberlock in
which you win automatically, and it cashes in on where ever your
opponents mishap meter is.<BR><BR>Reposite (attack parry): hold
attack while you parry block a swing. This only works if your already
in a preblock for the incoming swing or you are in the startfake
animation. This move causes a saberlock in which you win and
automatically causes a slowbounce on them unless they are high on the
mishap meter (where they will do whatever their level makes them
do)<BR><BR>Disarm (conversion): If you hit your opponents saber in a
heavybounce, they will get disarmed.<BR><BR>Superbreaks: Hold attack
at the end of a saberlock where you win. This will kill them
instantly , but this only works if your opponent's DP is low.
Otherwise, you will get slowbounced for trying it.<BR></FONT><BR>

Manual:</B> </FONT>
</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><BR>Before
getting in to the step-by-step instructions, it is important to cover
several basic aspects to this new saber system. <B>Without knowledge
of the key changes here, you will be confused about what is happening
to you in the combat, so it is very important to keep these in mind.</B>
The important changes include the following:<BR><BR>&bull; Regular
swings require holding down the attack button for at least half the
swing, otherwise you will perform a basic/start fake.<BR><BR>&bull;
All swings of the saber drain your Force Points (FP) depending on the
type of swing. When you have 10 FP or lower, your swings will slow
down greatly. This <BR>helps to prevent too much swinging.<BR><BR>&bull;
The Dodge Point (DP) meter, which is the second blue meter above you
FP meter (see Figure 1), drains as you absorb hits in different
amounts depending on the hit. Most of the time, it just acts as a
like a block meter; however, if you get hit while you are stunned,
disarmed, or knocked down, the dodge meter will act as a matrix style
dodge, which will drain you DP more than a regular hit. When it
flashed red, that means you have maybe one or tow more hits until
your dead or unable to block. Attack fakes (which will be explained
in the step-by step section) can be fatal to a person who is in the
red zone of DP.<BR>Note: You have have no DP when you jump, so
getting hit during a jump is usually fatal as well.<BR><BR>(Figure 1.
The DP meter) <BR><BR>&bull; This newest version of Enhanced has
added a &ldquo;Mishap meter&rdquo; or also referred to as a balance
meter (See figure 2). This meter controls whether or not you go into
a mishap from regular parries or attack fakes. It raises as you
swing, and lowers as you parry. At 40% its height, parries and attack
fakes on you will cause slowbounces and your meter will lower to
zero. At 66% height, parries and attack fakes on you will cause
heavybounces will also lower 25% or the next level down. When your
meter is maxed out You will go into a mishap and your meter will
reset (The slowbounces, heavybounces and mishaps will be explained in
more detail later) Vid
Example:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WupNyWU7UOQ" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WupNyWU7UOQ</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
(obiwan does it).<BR><BR><BR>(Figure 2: the Mishap Meter [The arrow
is pointing to it.])<BR><BR>&bull; Running is penalized during saber
combat by making you lose double DP when you get hit and cause a much
higher mishap probability. Hitting an opponent with a running swing
will do double DP damage; However, if you get hit during running and
swinging or running and hit from behind,  it will kill you instantly.
Because of this factor, it is essential to walk when swinging at a
saberist and getting hit by a saberist. This is to add to the movie
realism of this sabersystem since there is little running in the
movies during saber combat and to just keep it mostly toe to toe.<BR><BR>&bull;
Crouching is penalized by not being able to parry while in a crouch.
This is to stop crouching spam that we discovered was possible in our
beta testing.<BR><BR>&bull; There is only a very slight difference in
the speeds at which all the saber styles move and the swings are all
indefinitely chainable (even red stance). <BR><BR>&bull; Tavion's and
Desann's saber styles are now accessible with single saber and are
colored on the FP hud as aqua (Tavion's) and purple (Desann's).<BR><BR>&bull;
All the stances are a bit different in their DP damage scales, but
not nearly as different as in base JA. The damages are ordered from
weakest to strongest: duel and staff (which can often hit twice in
one swing), aqua, blue, yellow, purple, and red. Red and purple
stances have higher stun mishap thresholds then the other stances and
aqua and blue styles cause the earlier possibilities of slow bounce
conversions (which will be explained in the step-by-step section).<BR><BR>&bull;
The staff and dual saber styles have their own unique characteristics
as well. Staff costs no extra DP to get hit in the back making it a
great two-on-one weapon. Dual sabers have no attack fake costs for
direction changes (which I will explain later).<BR><BR>&bull; The
blue style lunge and yellow style flip attack are now usable by all
styles except staff and dual. Lunge do 1.25 times the damage of a
normal swing and flip attack do twice the DP damage of a regular
swing. Lunge is parried by holding forward and if you hit someone in
a lunge, you cause them double DP damage (lunge is also a great
option to break through someone&rsquo;s defense if they are
constantly parrying you). Flip attacks are also used for getting
behind your opponent. The aqua, blue, and yellow styles use a stab
flip attack while red and purple use the traditional slash. The
difference between the two is visual only.<BR><BR>&bull; Red and
purple styles have jump attacks, normally called a &ldquo;Death From
Above&rdquo; (DFA) that cause double the normal saber hit DP damage.
The red style uses a jumping hack version while purple uses a
spinning jump. They are also done the old JO way of first holding
attack to start the swing and then pressing and holding jump.<BR><BR>&bull;
All styles can kick by using the alternate weapon attack. Saber throw
has been turned into option in the force powers selection menu.<BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><BR>

is THE most important techniques to master.</B> It prevents you from
losing too much DP and makes your opponents mishap meter go up.
Parrying costs only 1/3 the normal amount of DP required to block a
saber attack which means it is the &ldquo;block&rdquo; of this game
more or less. You can usually parry even while swing except for maybe
at the peak for your swing (this knowledge is essential to winning
duels). Most parries do a knockaway animation (or onehanded block)
when do them right like in this vid:
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzRUxN89D4M" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzRUxN89D4M</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
The normal blocks just do normal block animations. Your opponent will
bounce more slowly once you parry him and stop him from comboing
(this is not in the video because its fairly new) Also look at the DP
meter in the vid to distinguish the DP damages.<BR><BR><B>Step 1:
Watch the angle at which your opponent's swing.</B> Watch whether
it's a high swing, coming from the side, or a lunge. Also watch the
angle at which it is about to hit you.<BR><BR><B>Step 2: Use your
forward, back, and side keys (w, a, s, and d) to move into the swing.</B>
It is important to remember that the direction for high swings is
inverted from what you might expect. You parry high swings by
pressing the back key (s). Side swings are parried by moving into the
swings with the side buttons (a and d).Lunges or low swings can be
parried by pressing forward (w). <BR><U>Note: The parry is determined
based on where you get hit. For example: If your player gets hit
lower on their body with a high diagonal swing, the proper parry
direction would be to move to that side.<BR></U><BR><B>Step 3: Check
if your opponent has been parried and/or if you do a knockaway
animation or lost less DP. </B><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: medium"> You
will do a one handed block and your opponent will bounce slowly if
you do it correctly. If you opponent was very high on mishap, he
might max out and fall over or lose his saber.</SPAN><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR></FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Exactly as they sound. Just run
and swing, These swings are the true power hits of this mod aside
from the DFAs because they do double the normal amount of DP damage.
These are VERY dangerous though because if you get hit while running
and swinging or get hit from behind while running with a saber, it
will kill you instantly. Sneaking These hits in can be very
beneficial, but they are easy to counter since you can just wave your
saber at a person and their running swing will most likely get them
killed (this is personal experience talking :p).  </FONT>

Feints:</B><BR>Attack feints are a very useful technique allows you
to fake swing in one direction and hit in another. The Attack fake
also causes one-third more damage than the regular swing. There is
also a cost of 1 FP for each change of direction you do in the
faking. This technique has been upgraded especially in 0.1.0. Now if
you hit your opponent without getting parried with this move, you
both will be forced into a very fast saberlock animation in which you
automatically win. If you get hit while trying an attack fake, the
attack fake you do will be cancelled. The Attack fake also does 1.25
times the damage of a normal swing and it cashes in on where ever
your opponent&rsquo;s mishap meter is (see the above info on the
mishap meter to find out what that is exactly). Heres a attackfake:

<BR><BR><B>Step 1: Look for an appropriate situation to use an attack
feint.</B> While usage of this technique is more personal preference
than anything, the best times to use this technique is starting at a
distance in order to avoid getting hit in the process. <BR><BR><B>Step
2: While pressing and holding attack and alternate attack, use the
directional keys to change direction of the swing.</B> By default,
the attack fakes will usually change directions at a 90 degree angle
unless you press in a different direction. The blur of your saber's
core will be longer then normal if you successfully do the attack
fake (see Figure 5). <BR>Note: There are versions of sabers that use
MB2&rsquo;s saber trail code floating around the OJP community. If
you use one of these sabers, use will not be able to see the longer
trail.<BR><BR>(Figure 6. Attack feint saber blur)<BR><BR><B>Step 3:
Hit your opponent with the attack feint at any part of their body
where their saber isn't in front of or in a place where you don't
believe it will be parried.</B> As with any swing, you have to be
careful about where you hit. Watch you opponent's movements because
if you hit high and they are moving backwards for example, you will
get parried. It is also good to transition into another swing if you
can in order to do more damage. You will know if you have
successfully hit your opponent without getting parried if you see
both of you go into a quick saberlock animation in which you win
automatically (this is more for visual effect than anything). If you
suspect that your opponent is in the DP red zone (if not, you'll get
slowbounced if you try it), hold the attack button until the end of
the saber lock and you will deliver a fatal or near fatal hit (this
is the Superbreak which will be discribed later).<BR><BR></FONT><BR>

<BR><BR>Step 1: Look for the right situation to use the windup fake.
Attack fakes have many uses depending on your personal preference.
You can use them to fake out an opponent, disguise a parry (which can
be done during the fake), and even block a swing for no DP cost if
you move your saber in front of the opponent's swing (this is a very
hard technique to do). It also causes a little DP damage on your
opponent at very close range.<BR><BR>Step 2: Tap the attack button
and press the directional buttons in the direction you want do the
basic fake or simply let go of the attack button during a windup or
transition<BR><BR>Step 3: Watch your opponent's reaction to the fake
and plan your next move based on that reaction.<BR><BR></FONT><BR>

in OJP Enhanced is more structured than it was in base JA. It is
available with all styles, but only works in certain situations in
order to avoid over usage. Any other instances using the kick other
than ones listed below will result the opponent absorbing the kick
with a low level back flip (just like the movies!) Vid Example:
</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uTt4EpQpLU" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uTt4EpQpLU</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
The effects of kicking someone are measured by your opponent's
balance/mishap bar. The higher their balance/mishap bar, the more
dangerous the effect will be. Also bare in mind that kicking lowers
your saber blocking defenses, so you will be vulnerable.<BR><BR>Step
1: Observe whether or not if your opponent is either in a slow
bounce, heavy bounce, a stun, has his back to you, or you think he
might be higher on his mishap bar or critical DP. These are the only
situations where kicking will knock your opponent down or make them
stumble.<BR><BR>Step 2: Execute the kick by pressing alternate attack
and the directional button towards your opponent (See Figure 7). Vid
Example: </FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Fw5gltTBk" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-Fw5gltTBk</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
<BR>(Figure 7. Kicking a normal slow bounce)<BR><BR>Step 3: Make
contact with you opponent and see whether they fall over or stumble.
This opens them up to being slashed at on the ground for a large DP
loss. Using lunge or ground stab is especially useful and damaging in
this situation (See Figure 8).<BR>Note: If your opponent's mishap bar
is less then about 1/3 of the way up, they will absorb the kick with
a backflip <BR>(Figure 8. Opponent falling over from kick) <BR><BR></FONT><BR>

Bounce Conversions:</B><BR>These are the hardest to perform, yet one
of the coolest and most rewarding features in OJP Enhanced. It is a
way to cause disarm mishaps before they could normally be caused
(sadly, they may not always happen if your ping is really high).
These also require your opponent to be in a heavy bounce. Vid
Example:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000ff"><U><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JknhF_R9fUs" TARGET="_blank"><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JknhF_R9fUs</FONT></A></U></FONT><FONT SIZE=2 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">
<BR><BR>Step 1: Observe if your opponent is in a more dynamic slow
bounce animation (See Figure 4) This happens when you reposit your
opponent at critical DP or Higher mishap. You can spot it because his
saber is sticking out further than normal and more perpendicular to
his body.<BR><BR>Step 2: Hit your opponent's saber before the
animation ends. This is very difficult to do in most cases. The best
way to do this is to use a straight downward chop. Faster styles have
a speed benefit at doing this as well as the ability to cause these
slow bounces on opponents with slightly higher DP than the other
styles are allowed.<BR><BR>Step 3: Observe your opponent to see if
they have enter a mishap. This will tell you whether or not you
conversion was successful. They will get disarmed if it is
successful. This allows you to follow up with a very damaging attack
of your preference.<BR><BR></FONT><BR>

is essentially the OJP finishing move. It requires the use of a move
that causes a saberlock whether it be an Attack Fake, Attack Parry
(if we keep it the way it is), or just a random lock. It only works
if you are the person who started that lock (since your opponent cant
fight it) and if your opponent is in the red zone of his DP meter (or
has little left). If both of these conditions are met, You will do
the old saberlock break animation and it will chop your opponent in
half!..usually. Vid Example:

<BR><BR><B>Step 1: Try to determine whether or not your opponent is
low on DP.</B> If you hear the grinding nose of him losing HP, thats
a good indication.<BR><BR><B>Step 2: Find a way to do a winning
saberlock on your opponent and hold the attack button to the end of
the saberlock.</B><BR><BR><B>Step 3: Observe to see if you do the
superbreak and your opponent is killed.</B> [Important note: If you
try and superbreak your opponent and he/she doesnt have low DP, you
yourself will get slowbounced!)<BR><BR><BR></FONT><BR>
