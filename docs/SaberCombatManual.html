  <font size="-1">(Original Author: JRHockney; Revisions: The Unbeholden; Editing 
  and Formatting: Causticus)</font> </p>
<p><strong><font size="+2">Introduction</font></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for downloading this mod and choosing to read this manual. It is 
  important to understand the revised system, otherwise it may seem random and 
  frustrating and you will die often and quickly (which happens much too often 
  and it shouldn't)!! </p>
<p>The purpose of this manual is to instruct players who are new to OJP Enhanced 
  on how to use the very different and unique saber system. This manual assumes 
  that you already have a moderate to advanced level of understanding on how the 
  base Jedi Academy saber system works. Without such knowledge, you will have 
  a more difficult time understanding the content of this manual. This manual 
  covers all of the major changes to the saber system and gives step-by-step instructions 
  on how to perform certain critical moves. It is important to note that the new 
  saber system was designed to be more cinematic than the base Jedi Academy saber 
  system.</p>
<p>Due to the length of this manual, a summarized Quick Start Guide has been included 
  to help players get right to the action without reading everything, however 
  it is highly recommend to still read the rest of the manual so you understand 
  the system in detail, including following the links to the visual movie references 
  for the moves (the HUD is a little dated on the movies though). The better you 
  understand the system, the more effective a saber dualist you will become.</p>
<br>
<p><strong><font size="+2">Quick Start Guide</font></strong></p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Important Notes</font></strong></p>

<strong>Figure 1</strong></span> 
<p>1. Dodge Points (DP) are indicated by the purple meter, referred to as your 
  dodge or block meter. It will go down very fast if you don't Parry-Block most 
  of the hits on you. When your defenses are down from a stumble, knock-down are 
  a saberless hit, you will dodge the hit matrix style and lose double DP.</p>
<p>2. Mishap Points (MP) are indicated by the empty meter that fills up as you 
  hit your opponent, referred to as your mishap (or off-balance) meter. It goes 
  up faster if your opponent Parry-Blocks you a lot. The more MP you have, the 
  more vulnerable you are to kicks, stumbling, and being knocked-down or disarmed.</p>
<p>3. You lose Force Points (FP) by swinging. At 10 FP or less, you swing and 
  move very slowly and are completely vulnerable to a lunge.</p>
<p>4. As a rule of thumb, walk at least 3/4ths of the time during a fight because 
  you lose double DP for hits on you if you run and it is fatal to be struck by 
  your opponent while you are jumping. Running and hitting someone will do double 
  DP damage to them, but if you get hit while swinging or from behind, it will 
  kill you instantly.</p>
<p>5. Comboing on your swings is often the key to winning a fight, but do it strategically 
  because you can still be beaten (or win) with pure defensive playing.</p>
<p>6. Kicks are available in all styles and take advantage of your opponent's 
  current MP level or when they are at critical DP. It will cause a knock-down 
  when your opponent's MP is near full or if they are at critical DP, a stumble 
  at around &frac12; MP, or get absorbed by a back flip when they are low. Holding 
  Alt-Attack when getting kicked will block or reduce your mishap effect at any 
  mishap level.</p>
<p>7. You will notice that you may occasionally get paused in the middle of combat 
  where you can not move. This is usually due to your MP becoming full and you 
  were Parry-Blocked or Riposted. You will be slow-bounced at 1/3+ MP, heavy-bounced 
  at 2/3+ MP or critical DP, and stumble or become disarmed or knocked-down at 
  9/10 MP. More info and visual references on these are in the official manual.</p>
<p>8. There are now a total of 7 styles to choose from at full saber attack points 
  in single saber. You can also do lunge and Yellow &quot;Death from Above&quot; 
  (DFA) in any single saber style and a Red DFA in both Purple and Red styles 
  (Purple style looks different in its DFA though).</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Moves</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Parry-Block</strong>:<br>
  This is the most important technique. Hold the directional key to move into 
  whatever side you are getting hit on (i.e. &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; for 
  side hits, &quot;S&quot; for high up-down swings, and &quot;W&quot; for lunge 
  and low hits). This move lessens hit damage on you greatly. If your opponent's 
  MP is very high, they may max out their mishap meter and fall down or lose their 
  saber.</p>
<p><strong>Start-Fake (aka Tap-Attack):</strong><br>
  Hold the Attack for less than half the swing. This fakes people out and is important 
  for Ripostes.</p>
<p><strong>Attack-Feint (aka Attack-Fake):</strong><br>
  Hold the Attack and Alt-Attack with a directional key (basically like doing 
  a kata except you are doing a normal swing with it). This does more damage than 
  a normal swing, puts your opponent into a saber-lock in which you win automatically, 
  and it takes advantage of your opponent's current MP level. If you are in a 
  saber-lock, you can break it by holding &quot;W&quot; (back) and Alt-Attack 
  unless you have low DP or high MP.</p>
<p><strong>Riposte (aka Attack-Parry):</strong><br>
  Hold Attack while you Parry-Block a swing. This only works if you are already 
  in a pre-block for the incoming swing or you are in the Start-Fake sequence. 
  This move causes a slow-bounce on your opponent unless they have a high MP in 
  which case they will do whatever their MP level dictates.</p>
<p><strong>Disarm:</strong><br>
  If you hit your opponent's saber while they are in a heavy-bounce, they will 
  be disarmed.</p>
<p><strong>Super-Break:</strong><br>
  Hold Attack at the end of a saber-lock where you win. If you opponent's DP is 
  low, you will instantly kill them, otherwise you will be slow-bounced for trying 
  it.</p>
<br>
<p><strong><font size="+2">Important General Knowledge</font></strong></p>
<p>Before getting in to the step-by-step instructions, it is important to cover 
  several basic aspects to this new saber system. Without knowledge of the key 
  changes here, you will be confused about what is happening to you in the combat, 
  so it is very important to keep these in mind. The important changes include 
  the following:</p>
<p>&#8226; Regular swings require holding down the Attack button for at least 
  half the swing, otherwise you will perform a Start-Fake.</p>
<span style="float:right;text-align:center"><img src="newmeter.png" alt="New Meter" width="248" height="294" hspace="10" border="0" align="texttop"/><br/>
<strong>Figure 2</strong></span> 
<p>&#8226; All swings of the saber drain your Force Points (FP) depending on the 
  type of swing. When you have 10 FP or lower, your swings will slow down greatly. 
  This helps to prevent too much swinging and button mashing, promoting skill 
  and swordsmanship and making for a better duel.</p>
<p>&#8226; The Dodge Points (DP) meter, which is the purple meter adjacent to 
  your Force Points meter (see Figure 2), drains as you absorb hits in different 
  amounts, depending on the hit. Most of the time, it just acts as a block meter; 
  however, if you are hit while you are stunned, disarmed, or knocked down, the 
  dodge meter will cause you to perform an automatic matrix-style dodge, which 
  will drain your DP more than a regular hit. When the DP meter flashes red, that 
  means you have maybe one or two more hits until you are unable to block or dodge 
  which can be fatal. Attack-Fakes, which are further explained in the step-by 
  step section, can be fatal to a person who is in the DP red zone. It is important 
  to note that your DP has no effect while you are jumping, so getting hit during 
  a jump is also usually fatal.</p>
<p>&#8226; This newest version of Enhanced has added a &quot;Mishap Meter&quot; 
  (see Figure 2) that displays your Mishap Points (MP) which are a measurement 
  of how balanced or off-balanced you are. This meter controls whether or not 
  you have a mishap from regular parries or Attack-Fakes. Your MP level increases 
  as you swing, and decreases as you parry. At 40%, parries and Attack-Fakes on 
  you will cause slow-bounces and your MP meter will decrease to zero. At 66%, 
  parries and Attack-Fakes on you will cause heavy-bounces and your MP will decrease 
  by 25% or to the next level down. When your meter is maxed out, you will have 
  a mishap and your meter will reset to zero. The slow-bounces, heavy-bounces 
  and mishaps will be explained in more detail later.</p>

<p>&#8226; Running is penalized during saber combat by making you lose double 
  DP when you get hit and causing a much higher mishap probability. Hitting an 
  opponent with a running swing will do one more DP damage; However, if you get 
  hit while running and swinging, or if you are hit from behind while running, 
  it will kill you instantly. Due to this factor, it is generally a better tactic 
  to walk when swinging at a saberist and to use extra care when running in the 
  vicinity of a saberist opponent. This is to add to the cinematic realism of 
  the revise saber system and to just keep it mostly toe to toe.</p>
<p>&#8226; Crouching is penalized by not being able to parry while in a crouch. 
  This is to prevent &quot;crouching spam&quot; that was discovered during beta 
  play testing.</p>
<p>&#8226; There is only a very slight difference in the speeds at which all the 
  saber styles move and the swings are all indefinitely chainable (even red stance).</p>
<p>&#8226; Tavion's and Desann's saber styles are now accessible with single saber 
  and are colored on the FP HUD as Aqua (Tavion's) and Purple (Desann's).</p>
<p>&#8226; All the stances are a bit different in their DP damage scales, but 
  not nearly as different as in base Jedi Academy. The damages are ordered from 
  weakest to strongest: 
<ol>
  <li>Duel and Staff (<em>which can often hit twice in one swing</em>)</li>
  <li>Aqua (<em>Tavion</em>)</li>
  <li>Blue</li>
  <li>Yellow</li>
  <li>Purple (<em>Desann</em>)</li>
  <li>Red</li>
</ol>
Red and Purple stances have higher stun mishap thresholds than the other stances 
and Aqua and Blue styles cause the earlier possibilities of slow bounce conversions 
(which will be explained in the step-by-step section).</p> 
<p>&#8226; The Staff and Dual saber styles have their own unique characteristics 
  as well. Staff costs no extra DP to get hit in the back making it a great two-on-one 
  weapon. Dual sabers have no Attack Fake costs for direction changes (which is 
  explained later).</p>
<p>&#8226; The Blue style lunge and Yellow style flip attack are now usable by 
  all styles except Staff and Dual. Lunge does 25% more damage than a normal swing 
  and flip attack does twice the DP damage of a regular swing. Lunge is parried 
  by holding forward (&quot;W&quot;) and if you hit someone in a lunge, you cause 
  them double DP damage (lunge is also a great option to break through someone's 
  defense if they are constantly parrying you). Flip attacks are used for getting 
  behind your opponent. The Aqua, Blue, and Yellow styles use a stab flip attack 
  while red and purple use the traditional slash. The difference between the two 
  is visual only.</p>
<p>&#8226; Red and Purple styles have jump attacks, normally called a &quot;Death 
  From Above&quot; (DFA) that cause double the normal saber hit DP damage. The 
  Red style uses a jumping hack version while Purple uses a spinning jump. They 
  are performed by first holding Attack to start the swing and then pressing and 
  holding jump (the old JO way).</p>
<p>&#8226; All styles can kick by using the alternate weapon attack. Saber throw 
  has become an option in the force powers selection menu.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Parrying</font></strong></p>

2</strong></a></span> 
<p>Parrying is the most important technique to master. It prevents you from losing 
  too much DP and increases your opponents mishap meter. Parrying costs only 1/3 
  the normal amount of DP required to block a saber attack which means it is the 
  &quot;block&quot; of this game more or less. You can usually parry even while 
  swinging except for maybe at the peak for your swing (this knowledge is essential 
  to winning duels). Most parries do a knock-away animation (or one-handed block) 
  when performed correctly. The normal blocks just do normal block animations. 
  Your opponent will bounce more slowly once you parry him and stop him from comboing 
  (this is not in the video because its fairly new) Also look at the DP meter 
  in the video to distinguish the DP damages.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Watch the angle at which your opponent's swing.</strong> 
  Determine whether it is a high swing, coming from the side, or a lunge, but 
  also watch the angle at which it is about to hit you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Use your forward, left, back and right keys (&quot;W&quot;, 
  &quot;A&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;) to move into the swing.</strong> 
  It is important to remember that the direction for high swings is inverted from 
  what you might expect, i.e. you parry high swings by pressing the back key (&quot;S&quot;). 
  Side swings are parried by moving into the swings with the side buttons (&quot;A&quot; 
  and &quot;D&quot;). Lunges or low swings can be parried by pressing forward 
  (&quot;W&quot;).<br>
  <br>
  <em>Note:</em> The parry is determined based on where you get hit. For example, 
  if you get hit lower on your body with a high diagonal swing, the proper parry 
  direction would be to move to that side.</p>
<p>If you performed the parry successfully, your opponent's attack will be knocked-away 
  and you will lose minimal DP. Visually, you will do a one-handed block and your 
  opponent will bounce slowly. If your opponent's mishap meter was near full, 
  they might max out and fall over or lose their saber.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Running Swings</font></strong></p>
<p>Just as it sounds - just run and swing. These swings are the true power hits 
  of this mod aside from the DFAs because they do more than the normal amount 
  of DP damage, however these are very dangerous because if you are hit while 
  running and swinging or are hit from behind while running with a saber, it will 
  kill you instantly. Sneaking these hits in can be very beneficial, but they 
  are easy to counter since you can just wave your saber at a running opponent 
  and their running swing will most likely get them killed.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Block-to-Swing / Swing-to-Swing Transitions</font></strong></p>
<p>This technique allows you to bounce out of your block into a swing faster than 
  you usually would, or allows you to combo easier in different directions when 
  your attack bounces off an opponent's saber. It is a very effective way of countering 
  or making a follow-up attack after you have blocked or made an unsuccessful 
  attack.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Watch for a saber block or a bounce hit off 
  an opponent.</strong> If your opponent parries you, you'll bounce slowly and 
  will not be able to do the transition.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Hold the Attack button and press a different 
  movement direction than you blocked or swung in.</strong> Alternatively, just 
  keep holding the Attack button and what ever direction your were holding before 
  and it will automatically switch.</p>
<p>If your transition was successful, you will usually get the first hit and force 
  a block by your opponent. If used correctly, you can chain several of these 
  swings and do a lot of DP damage on your opponent.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Attack Fakes</font></strong></p>
<p>Attack Fakes are a very useful technique that allows you to fake a swing in 
  one direction and hit in another. The Attack Fake causes one-third more damage 
  than the regular swing, however there is also a cost of 1 FP for each change 
  of direction you do in the faking. This technique has been upgraded in OJP v0.1.0. 
  Now if you hit your opponent with this move without being parried, you both 
  will be forced into a very fast saber-lock animation in which you automatically 
  win. If you get hit while trying an Attack Fake, the Attack Fake you do will 
  be cancelled. The Attack Fake causes 25% more damage than a normal swing and 
  can take advantage of your opponent's current MP level.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Look for an appropriate situation to use an 
  attack feint.</strong> Until you are comfortable with the timing of this technique, 
  it is generally recommended to use this technique starting at a distance in 
  order to avoid getting hit in the process.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>While pressing and holding Attack and Alt-Attack, 
  use the directional keys to change direction of the swing.</strong> By default, 
  the Attack Fakes will usually change directions at a 90 degree angle unless 
  you press in a different direction. The blur of your saber's core will be longer 
  then normal if you successfully do the Attack Fake.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Note:</em> There are versions of sabers that use MB2's saber trail code 
  floating around the OJP community. If you use one of these sabers, you will 
  not be able to see the longer trail.</p>
<p>Try to hit your opponent with the Attack Fake at any location that their saber 
  is not guarding, or where you are least likely to be parried. As with any swing, 
  watch your opponent's movements and plan carefully where you want to hit. For 
  example, if you hit high and they are moving backward, you will be automatically 
  parried. It is also good to transition into another swing if you can in order 
  to continue the attack and do more damage. You will know if you have successfully 
  hit your opponent without being parried if you see both of you go into a quick 
  saber-lock animation in which you win automatically (this is more for visual 
  effect than anything). If you suspect that your opponent is in the DP red zone, 
  hold the attack button until the end of the saber lock and you will deliver 
  a fatal or near fatal hit (this is the Superbreak which will be described later 
  - use with caution as if they are not in the DP red zone, you will be slow-bounced 
  for trying it, leaving you open to a counter attack).</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Start Fakes</font></strong></p>
<p>These are occasionally referred to as wind up fakes or basic fakes. Start Fakes 
  are a lot more straight-forward than Attack Fakes, but still useful in many 
  ways. They cost no FP to use.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Look for the right situation to use the Start 
  Fake.</strong> Attack fakes have many uses depending on your personal preference. 
  You can use them to fake out an opponent, disguise a parry (which can be done 
  during the fake), and even block a swing for no DP cost if you move your saber 
  in front of the opponent's swing (this is a very hard technique to do, but it 
  also causes a little DP damage on your opponent at very close range).</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Tap the attack button and press the directional 
  button for the desired Start Fake, or simply let go of the attack button during 
  a windup or transition.</strong></p>

<p>A new move in this version of Enhanced is the Riposte or Attack Parry and uses 
  the Start Fake as its aid. This will do exactly what all parries did in the 
  previous version of Enhanced which is cause a slow bounce. This parry, however, 
  does not completely rely on the mishap meter, causing a slow-bounce at any low 
  point on the mishap meter, or a heavy bounce at higher points on the mishap 
  meter (usually 66% or higher) or at critical DP.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Watch where and when your opponents saber 
  is about to hit you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Hold the proper parry direction as per regular 
  parry and tap attack just as your opponents saber is about to hit you</strong> 
  (sometimes taping it at the same time works to). You must be in a pre-block 
  animation or a Start Fake animation for it to work, but you cannot be holding 
  attack at the time of hit.</p>
<p>If performed properly, your opponent will go into a slow-bounce or heavy bounce.</p>

<p>Kicking in OJP Enhanced is more structured than it was in base Jedi Academy. 
  It is available with all styles, but only works in certain situations in order 
  to avoid over usage. Any other instances using the kick other than ones listed 
  below will result the opponent absorbing the kick with a low level back flip 
  - just like the movies (See Video 8)! The effects of kicking someone are measured 
  by your opponent's current MP level. The higher their MP, the more effective 
  the kick will be on them. Also keep in mind that getting hit by your opponents 
  saber while attempting a kick does more damage to you and you can not parry 
  their swing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Observe whether or not if your opponent is 
  either in a slow bounce, heavy bounce, a stun, has his back to you, or you think 
  he might be higher on his mishap bar or critical DP. </strong>These are the 
  only situations where kicking will knock your opponent down or make them stumble.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Execute the kick by pressing alternate attack 
  and the directional button towards your opponent</strong> (See Video 9).</p>
<p>When executed correctly, your opponent will fall over or stumble. This opens 
  them up to being slashed at on the ground for a large DP loss. Using lunge or 
  ground stab is especially useful and damaging in this situation.<br>
  <br>
  <em>Note:</em> If your opponent's mishap bar is less then about 1/3 of the way 
  up, they will absorb the kick with a back flip</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Slow Bounce Conversions</font></strong></p>
<p>These are the hardest to perform, yet one of the coolest and most rewarding 
  features in OJP Enhanced. It is a way to cause disarm mishaps before they could 
  normally be caused (sadly, they may not always happen if your ping is really 
  high). These also require your opponent to be in a heavy bounce.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Observe if your opponent is in a more dynamic 
  slow bounce animation.</strong> This happens when you Riposte your opponent 
  at critical DP or a high MP. Their saber and arm will be extended further away 
  from and more perpendicular to their body than normal.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Hit your opponent's saber before the animation 
  ends.</strong> This is very difficult to do in most cases. The best way to do 
  this is to use a straight downward chop. Faster styles have a speed benefit 
  at doing this as well as the ability to cause these slow bounces on opponents 
  with slightly higher DP than the other styles are allowed.</p>
<p>When performed correctly, your opponent will enter a mishap, becoming disarmed, 
  at which time you may follow up with a very damaging attack of your preference.</p>
<p><strong><font size="+1">Superbreaks</font></strong></p>
<p>This is essentially the OJP &quot;finishing move&quot;. It requires the use 
  of a move that causes a saber-lock, whether it be an Attack Fake, Attack Parry, 
  or just a random lock. It only works if you are the person who initiated the 
  lock and if your opponent is in the red zone of their DP meter (or has very 
  little left). If both of these conditions are met, you will do the old saber-lock 
  break animation and it will chop your opponent in half! (...usually)</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Try to determine whether or not your opponent 
  is low on DP.</strong> If you hear the grinding nose of him losing HP, that 
  is a good indication.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Find a way to do a winning saber-lock on your 
  opponent and hold the attack button to the end of the saber-lock.</strong></p>
<p><em>Important note:</em> If you try and Superbreak your opponent and they do 
  not have low DP, you yourself will be slow-bounced!</p>
